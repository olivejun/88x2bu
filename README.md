# 88x2bu

Linux Driver for the RealTek RTL8812BU and RTL8822BU Chipsets.

Driver version 5.8.7.1 from Realtek. I have tested the driver on Ubuntu 20.04, Linux Mint 20 and Linux Mint 19.3. I saw clean compiles on all three tests. Basic function tests on a rtl8812bu based USB device were successful. I will update this readme with additional information once the driver is uploaded and tested.
